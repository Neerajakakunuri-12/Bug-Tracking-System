## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
* Apache Maven
* MySQL Server (and a client like MySQL Workbench)
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Neerajakakunuri-12/Bug-Tracking-System.git](https://github.com/Neerajakakunuri-12/Bug-Tracking-System.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Bug-Tracking-System
    ```

3.  **Setup the Database:**
    * Make sure your MySQL server is running.
    * Create a new database schema (e.g., `bugtracker_db`).
    * The repository may contain a `.sql` file to create the `bug_reports` table. If so, run that script in your new database schema.

4.  **Configure the Application:**
    * Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
    * **Important:** Right now, the project is configured to exclude the database connection. To connect to your MySQL database in the future, you would update this file with your database URL, username, and password like this:
        ```properties
        # spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bugtracker_db
        # spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
        # spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
        # spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
        ```

5.  **Build and Run:**
    * Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`
    * Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run` (or by running the `BugtrackerApplication.java` file from your IDE).

6.  **Access the application:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## üóÇ Database Table Structure

The application is designed to work with the following table structure in MySQL.

**Table name: `bug_reports`**

| Column Name      | Data Type                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `bug_id`         | INT (AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY) |
| `title`          | VARCHAR(100)                      |
| `description`    | TEXT                              |
| `project_name`   | VARCHAR(100)                      |
| `priority`       | VARCHAR(50)                       |
| `status`         | VARCHAR(50)                       |
| `reporter_name`  | VARCHAR(100)                      |
